## Prompt:
python sort array  based val[0] is same then take val[1]
  
[[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]]

## Response:
You can sort the array in Python using **`sorted()`** with a custom key.  
If you want to sort primarily by the first element (`val[0]`) and, when equal, by the second (`val[1]`), you can do this:

```python
arr = [[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]]

sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

print(sorted_arr)
```

‚úÖ Output:

```python
[[1, 11], [1, 100], [2, 12], [11, 22]]
```

This works because `(x[0], x[1])` creates a tuple, and Python sorts tuples lexicographically.

Do you also want it in **descending order** (e.g., highest first), or only ascending?

## Prompt:
increasing order

## Response:
Perfect üëç ‚Äî the code I gave already sorts in **increasing order** for both `val[0]` and `val[1]`.

Here‚Äôs the clean version again:

```python
arr = [[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]]

arr.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))   # in-place sort

print(arr)
```

üëâ Output:

```
[[1, 11], [1, 100], [2, 12], [11, 22]]
```

Would you like me to also show you how to handle **mixed ascending/descending** (e.g., `val[0]` ascending but `val[1]` descending)?

## Prompt:
(x[0], x[1]) creates a tuple, and Python sorts tuples lexicographically. ?

## Response:
Yes, exactly ‚úÖ

In Python, when you sort a list of tuples (or anything that can be converted into a tuple), the sorting happens **lexicographically** ‚Äî just like words in a dictionary.

That means:

1.  Compare the **first element** of each tuple.
2.  If they‚Äôre different ‚Üí the smaller one decides the order.
3.  If they‚Äôre the same ‚Üí then compare the **second element**.
4.  If still the same ‚Üí compare the **third**, and so on.

* * *

### Example:

```python
arr = [(1, 100), (11, 22), (1, 11), (2, 12)]

sorted_arr = sorted(arr)

print(sorted_arr)
```

üîπ Output:

```
[(1, 11), (1, 100), (2, 12), (11, 22)]
```

* * *

### Why it works for your case

When we do:

```python
sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```

the `lambda` makes each `[a, b]` into a tuple `(a, b)`.  
Then Python sorts tuples lexicographically, giving you the correct **"first by x\[0\], then by x\[1\]"** order.

* * *

Would you like me to also explain with a **step-by-step comparison example** of how Python decides between `[1,100]` and `[1,11]`?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Great! Let‚Äôs walk through it step by step with your array:

```python
arr = [[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]]
```

We sort using:

```python
arr.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```

So Python converts each element into a tuple `(x[0], x[1])`:

```
[1,100] ‚Üí (1,100)  
[11,22] ‚Üí (11,22)  
[1,11] ‚Üí (1,11)  
[2,12] ‚Üí (2,12)  
```

* * *

### Step-by-step comparisons

1.  Compare `(1,100)` vs `(11,22)`
    *   First elements: `1 < 11` ‚Üí `(1,100)` comes before `(11,22)`.
2.  Compare `(1,100)` vs `(1,11)`
    *   First elements: `1 == 1` ‚Üí move to second elements.
    *   Compare `100` vs `11`: since `11 < 100`, `(1,11)` comes before `(1,100)`.
3.  Compare `(1,11)` vs `(2,12)`
    *   First elements: `1 < 2` ‚Üí `(1,11)` comes before `(2,12)`.
4.  Compare `(2,12)` vs `(11,22)`
    *   First elements: `2 < 11` ‚Üí `(2,12)` comes before `(11,22)`.

* * *

### Final sorted result

```
[(1,11), (1,100), (2,12), (11,22)]
```

Or in your original list format:

```
[[1, 11], [1, 100], [2, 12], [11, 22]]
```

* * *

‚ö° So the rule is: Python sorts **like a dictionary order**:

*   Compare first number ‚Üí if tie, compare second ‚Üí if tie, compare third‚Ä¶

Would you like me to also show how this works with **more than 2 elements** per sublist, e.g. `[[1,2,3], [1,2,1], [1,1,5]]`?
