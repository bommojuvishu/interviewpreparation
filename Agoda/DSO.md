## Response:
Great! Here’s a focused **7-day plan for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** tailored to **Agoda-style interviews** and **full-stack engineering roles**. You’ll practice problem-solving, reinforce patterns, and simulate real interview scenarios. This plan assumes ~1.5–2 hours per day.

🧠 7-Day DSA Prep Plan (With Daily Focus and Practice Problems)
---------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

### **Day 1: Arrays & Hashing**

📚 **Topics to cover:**

*   Stack basics
    
*   Monotonic stack pattern
    

🧪 **Problems to solve:**

*   Valid Parentheses (Easy)
    
*   Daily Temperatures (Medium)
    
*   Largest Rectangle in Histogram (Hard) – optional stretch
    

* * *

### **Day 4: Linked Lists**

*   In-place reversal
    

🧪 **Problems to solve:**

*   Reverse Linked List (Easy)
    
*   Linked List Cycle (Easy)
    
*   Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)
    

* * *

### **Day 5: Trees & Recursion**

**Goal:** Build comfort with recursion and tree traversal patterns.

🌳 **Topics to cover:**

*   DFS (inorder, preorder, postorder)
    
*   Recursion patterns
    

🧪 **Problems to solve:**

*   Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Easy)

*   Detecting cycles in undirected/graph
    

🧪 **Problems to solve:**

*   Number of Islands (Medium)
    
*   Clone Graph (Medium)
    
*   Course Schedule (Medium)
    

* * *

### **Day 7: Mock Interview Day (Full Simulation)**

🎯 **Goal:** Simulate a real DSA round + review all core patterns.

🧪 **Mock Problems** (choose 2–3 to solve with a timer ~45 min total):

*   LRU Cache (Medium)
    
*   Top K Frequent Elements (Medium)
    
*   Kth Largest Element in an Array (Medium)
    

📝 **Also do:**

*   Review all mistakes from the past week.
    
*   Revisit 2 problems you couldn’t solve initially and explain the solution out loud.
    

* * *

✅ Tips
------

*   Solve in **TypeScript or Python**, whichever language you’ll use in the interview.
    
*   Use [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) or [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/) for short video explanations.
    
*   Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or pen/paper to draw tree/graph visuals when stuck.
    

* * *

Would you like a **daily reminder with links** or a **printable tracker PDF**? I can also run a **mock DSA interview** with timer and feedback.
