## Prompt:
stacks DSA problems with their leetcode links

2/2

## Response:
Here’s a **well-organized list of important Stack Data Structure problems** with their **LeetCode links**, categorized by difficulty and concept — perfect for DSA prep 👇

* * *

### 🟢 **Easy Level (Basics of Stack)**

These help you get comfortable with the stack data structure — push, pop, peek, and basic applications.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Valid Parentheses | 🔗 Link |
| 2 | Min Stack | 🔗 Link |
| 3 | Implement Stack using Queues | 🔗 Link |
| 4 | Remove Outermost Parentheses | 🔗 Link |
| 5 | Baseball Game | 🔗 Link |

* * *

### 🟡 **Medium Level (Monotonic Stacks & Expressions)**

These test your understanding of **monotonic stacks**, **expression evaluation**, and **previous/next greater elements**.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | Next Greater Element II | 🔗 Link |
| 7 | Daily Temperatures | 🔗 Link |
| 8 | Asteroid Collision | 🔗 Link |
| 9 | Simplify Path | 🔗 Link |
| 10 | Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation | 🔗 Link |
| 11 | Online Stock Span | 🔗 Link |
| 12 | Next Greater Element I | 🔗 Link |

* * *

### 🔴 **Hard Level (Advanced Applications)**

These require **monotonic stack + dynamic programming / range queries** — often seen in interviews at top companies.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | Largest Rectangle in Histogram | 🔗 Link |
| 14 | Maximal Rectangle | 🔗 Link |
| 15 | Trapping Rain Water | 🔗 Link |
| 16 | Basic Calculator | 🔗 Link |
| 17 | Basic Calculator II | 🔗 Link |
| 18 | Remove K Digits | 🔗 Link |

* * *

### 🌟 **Bonus — Stack Patterns to Master**

*   **Monotonic Increasing Stack** → Next Greater Element, Histogram
*   **Monotonic Decreasing Stack** → Previous Greater Element, Stock Span
*   **Two Stack Calculators** → Expression evaluation, reverse Polish
*   **Stack + String Parsing** → Parentheses, simplify path, calculators
*   **Stack + DP / Greedy** → Largest Rectangle, Trapping Rain Water, Remove K digits

* * *

Would you like me to give you a **progress plan (e.g., 1 week / 2 weeks)** to solve these stack problems in order (with increasing difficulty)? 📝🔥

## Prompt:
what about queues

## Response:
Great question 🙌  
Here’s a **well-structured list of important Queue Data Structure problems** on **LeetCode**, grouped by difficulty and concept — covering **normal queues, circular queues, sliding windows, BFS applications**, and more 👇

* * *

### 🟢 **Easy Level (Queue Basics)**

Start here to get familiar with **basic enqueue/dequeue operations** and simple applications.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Implement Queue using Stacks | 🔗 Link |
| 2 | Design Circular Queue | 🔗 Link |
| 3 | Number of Recent Calls | 🔗 Link |
| 4 | Moving Average from Data Stream | 🔗 Link |
| 5 | Time Needed to Buy Tickets | 🔗 Link |

* * *

### 🟡 **Medium Level (Sliding Window & BFS)**

These problems involve **queues in sliding windows**, **monotonic queues**, and **level-order traversals**.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | Sliding Window Maximum | 🔗 Link |
| 7 | Rotting Oranges | 🔗 Link |
| 8 | Dota2 Senate | 🔗 Link |
| 9 | Shortest Path in Binary Matrix | 🔗 Link |
| 10 | Walls and Gates | 🔗 Link |
| 11 | Perfect Squares | 🔗 Link |
| 12 | Open the Lock | 🔗 Link |

👉 **Key Patterns Here**:

*   **Monotonic Deque** → Sliding Window Maximum
*   **BFS (Queue)** → Shortest path, Rotting Oranges, Open Lock
*   **Simulation Queue** → Dota2 Senate

* * *

### 🔴 **Hard Level (Advanced Queue Applications)**

These require **optimized queue usage**, often combined with **graphs, BFS on grids**, or **priority queues**.

| # | Problem | LeetCode Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | Minimum Window Subsequence | 🔗 Link |
| 14 | Trapping Rain Water II (BFS + Priority Queue) | 🔗 Link |
| 15 | Bus Routes | 🔗 Link |
| 16 | Sliding Window Median | 🔗 Link |

* * *

### 🌟 **Queue Patterns to Master**

| Pattern | Key Use Cases |
| --- | --- |
| **Normal Queue** | Simple FIFO problems, simulations |
| **Circular Queue** | Design data structures |
| **Monotonic Queue / Deque** | Sliding window max/min problems |
| **BFS Queue** | Level order traversal, shortest path in matrix/graph |
| **Double-ended Queue (Deque)** | Sliding window optimizations |
| **Priority Queue (Heap)** | Advanced queue + greedy/BFS problems |

* * *

Would you like me to give you a **1–2 week solving schedule** for these Queue problems (like I can for Stacks), with daily topic-based progression? 📝🔥
