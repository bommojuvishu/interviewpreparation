## Prompt:
Floyd-Warshall  algorithm

## Response:
The **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** is a classic **dynamic programming** technique used to find the **shortest paths between all pairs of vertices** in a **weighted graph**. It works for both **directed and undirected graphs**, and it can handle **negative edge weights**, as long as there are **no negative cycles**.

* * *

### 🔧 Use Case:

Given a graph  $G = (V, E)$  with weight  $w(u, v)$ , the Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest distance between **every pair** of nodes.

* * *

### 🧠 Algorithm Idea:

Let `dist[i][j]` be the shortest distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

We initialize:

*   `dist[i][j] = weight(i, j)` if there is an edge from `i` to `j`
    
*   `dist[i][j] = 0` if `i == j`
    
*   `dist[i][j] = ∞` if no edge exists
    

Then, for every vertex `k` from 1 to N:

```python
for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
```

* * *

### 💻 Python Implementation:

```python
def floyd_warshall(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [row[:] for row in graph]  # Deep copy of the graph

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

    return dist
```

* * *

### 📥 Input:

Graph as a 2D matrix `graph[i][j]` representing weights (use `float('inf')` for no edge).

### 📤 Output:

2D matrix `dist[i][j]` with shortest distances between all pairs.

* * *

### 🔍 Example:

```python
INF = float('inf')
graph = [
    [0, 3, INF, 5],
    [2, 0, INF, 4],
    [INF, 1, 0, INF],
    [INF, INF, 2, 0]
]

result = floyd_warshall(graph)

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

* * *

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

**O(V³)** – where V is the number of vertices.

* * *

### ⚠️ Notes:

*   Detect negative cycles by checking if `dist[i][i] < 0` after running the algorithm.
    
*   Great for dense graphs or where all-pairs shortest paths are needed.
    

Let me know if you want a visualization or need it implemented for a specific problem.

## Prompt:
visualization

## Response:
Here’s a **visualization explanation** of how the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** works step-by-step. Let's go with a small graph to keep it simple.

* * *

### 🎯 Sample Graph (with 4 nodes):

We'll use this graph represented as an adjacency matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0 [ 0,  5, ∞, 10 ]
1 [ ∞,  0,  3, ∞  ]
2 [ ∞, ∞,  0,  1  ]
3 [ ∞, ∞, ∞,  0  ]
```

*   `∞` means there is no direct edge between the nodes.
    

* * *

### 🧠 Initialization:

We start with the same matrix:

```
Initial dist[i][j]:
[
 [0,  5, ∞, 10],
 [∞,  0, 3,  ∞],
 [∞, ∞, 0,  1],
 [∞, ∞, ∞, 0]
]
```

* * *

### 🔄 Iteration Steps:

We consider each node `k` as an intermediate node and update the matrix.

#### 🧩 k = 0

*   Try going through node `0` to see if we can get a shorter path.
    

Nothing changes because there are no new shortcuts through node `0`.

#### 🧩 k = 1

We update `dist[0][2]`:

*   `dist[0][1] + dist[1][2] = 5 + 3 = 8` < `∞`, so update `dist[0][2] = 8`
    

Final update:

```
[
 [0, 5,  8, 10],
 [∞, 0,  3, ∞ ],
 [∞, ∞, 0,  1],
 [∞, ∞, ∞, 0 ]
]
```

#### 🧩 k = 2

*   `dist[1][3] = dist[1][2] + dist[2][3] = 3 + 1 = 4`
    
*   `dist[0][3] = min(10, 8 + 1) = 9`
    

Final update:

```
[
 [0, 5, 8,  9],
 [∞, 0, 3,  4],
 [∞, ∞, 0,  1],
 [∞, ∞, ∞, 0]
]
```

#### 🧩 k = 3

No changes — node `3` doesn't offer any shorter paths.

* * *

### ✅ Final Shortest Path Matrix:

```
[
 [0, 5, 8,  9],
 [∞, 0, 3,  4],
 [∞, ∞, 0,  1],
 [∞, ∞, ∞, 0]
]
```
