## Response:

Dijkstra's algorithm is a **graph search algorithm** used to find the **shortest path** from a **single source vertex** to all other vertices in a **weighted graph** with **non-negative edge weights**.

---

## **How It Works**

1.  **Initialize Distances**: Set the distance of the source vertex to 0 and all others to infinity.
2.  **Use a Min-Priority Queue**: Maintain a min-heap (or priority queue) to always expand the nearest unvisited node.
3.  **Relax Edges**: For each adjacent vertex, update the shortest known distance if a shorter path is found.
4.  **Mark as Visited**: Once a vertex is processed (i.e., all its neighbors are relaxed), mark it as visited.
5.  **Repeat Until Done**: Continue until all vertices are processed.

---

## **Time Complexity**

- **Using a simple array**: $O(V^2)$
- **Using a priority queue (Min-Heap)**: $O((V + E) \log V)$ , where:

  - $V$ is the number of vertices

  - $E$ is the number of edges

---

## **Implementation in Python**

```python
import heapq
import sys

# Function to construct adjacency
def constructAdj(edges, V):

    # adj[u] = list of [v, wt]
    adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    for edge in edges:
        u, v, wt = edge
        adj[u].append([v, wt])
        adj[v].append([u, wt])

    return adj

# Returns shortest distances from src to all other vertices
def dijkstra(V, edges, src):
    # Create adjacency list
    adj = constructAdj(edges, V)

    # Create a priority queue to store vertices that
    # are being preprocessed.
    pq = []

    # Create a list for distances and initialize all
    # distances as infinite
    dist = [sys.maxsize] * V

    # Insert source itself in priority queue and initialize
    # its distance as 0.
    heapq.heappush(pq, [0, src])
    dist[src] = 0

    # Looping till priority queue becomes empty (or all
    # distances are not finalized)
    while pq:
        # The first vertex in pair is the minimum distance
        # vertex, extract it from priority queue.
        u = heapq.heappop(pq)[1]

        # Get all adjacent of u.
        for x in adj[u]:
            # Get vertex label and weight of current
            # adjacent of u.
            v, weight = x[0], x[1]

            # If there is shorter path to v through u.
            if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight:
                # Updating distance of v
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, [dist[v], v])

    # Return the shortest distance array
    return dist

# Driver program to test methods of graph class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    V = 5
    src = 0

    # edge list format: {u, v, weight}
    edges =[[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 8], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 10]];

    result = dijkstra(V, edges, src)

    # Print shortest distances in one line
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

```

Do you want a more detailed explanation with a step-by-step example? ðŸ˜Š

## Response:

Let's go through **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm step by step** with a small example.

---

## **Example Graph**

Consider this graph with **four nodes (A, B, C, D)** and the given weights:

```
       (1)
    A ------ B
     \      / \
   (4) \  (2) (5)
       C ------ D
         (1)
```

**Graph Representation (Adjacency List)**:

```
A â†’ B (1), C (4)
B â†’ A (1), C (2), D (5)
C â†’ A (4), B (2), D (1)
D â†’ B (5), C (1)
```

### **Goal**

Find the **shortest path** from **A** to all other nodes.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution**

1.  **Initialization**

    - Start at **A**. Set:

      - `distance(A) = 0` (starting point)
      - `distance(B) = âˆž`
      - `distance(C) = âˆž`
      - `distance(D) = âˆž`

    - Unvisited nodes: `{A, B, C, D}`
    - Priority Queue: `[(0, A)]`

---

2.  **Processing Node A (Smallest Distance)**

    - Current node = **A** (distance `0`)
    - Visit its neighbors:

      - **B**: `distance(A) + weight(A â†’ B) = 0 + 1 = 1`
      - **C**: `distance(A) + weight(A â†’ C) = 0 + 4 = 4`

    - Update distances:

      - `distance(B) = 1`
      - `distance(C) = 4`

    - Add `(1, B)` and `(4, C)` to the priority queue.
    - Unvisited nodes: `{B, C, D}`
    - **Priority Queue**: `[(1, B), (4, C)]`

---

3.  **Processing Node B**

    - Current node = **B** (distance `1`)
    - Visit its neighbors:

      - **A** (already visited, ignore)
      - **C**: `distance(B) + weight(B â†’ C) = 1 + 2 = 3` (update, since `3 < 4`)
      - **D**: `distance(B) + weight(B â†’ D) = 1 + 5 = 6`

    - Update distances:

      - `distance(C) = 3`
      - `distance(D) = 6`

    - Add `(3, C)` and `(6, D)` to the priority queue.
    - Unvisited nodes: `{C, D}`
    - **Priority Queue**: `[(3, C), (4, C), (6, D)]`

---

4.  **Processing Node C**

    - Current node = **C** (distance `3`)
    - Visit its neighbors:

      - **A** (ignore)
      - **B** (ignore)
      - **D**: `distance(C) + weight(C â†’ D) = 3 + 1 = 4` (update, since `4 < 6`)

    - Update distances:

      - `distance(D) = 4`

    - Add `(4, D)` to the priority queue.
    - Unvisited nodes: `{D}`
    - **Priority Queue**: `[(4, C), (4, D), (6, D)]`

---

5.  **Processing Node D**

    - Current node = **D** (distance `4`)
    - Visit its neighbors:

      - **B** (ignore)
      - **C** (ignore)

    - No changes needed.
    - **Priority Queue**: `[(6, D)]` (but D is already processed, so we stop)

---

## **Final Shortest Distances**

| Node  | Shortest Distance from A |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| **A** | 0                        |
| **B** | 1                        |
| **C** | 3                        |
| **D** | 4                        |

So, the **shortest paths** from **A**:

- **A â†’ B** (1)
- **A â†’ B â†’ C** (3)
- **A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D** (4)

---

## **Key Observations**

- The algorithm always **expands the nearest unvisited node**.
- Once a node is processed, its distance is **final**.
- Works well with **non-negative** weights.

---

## **Time Complexity**

- **Using Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: ** $O((V + E) \log V)$ **
- **Using Simple Array**: ** $O(V^2)$ ** (slower for large graphs)

---

## **Python Implementation**

Here's how you can implement it:

```python
import heapq
import sys

# Function to construct adjacency
def constructAdj(edges, V):

    # adj[u] = list of [v, wt]
    adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    for edge in edges:
        u, v, wt = edge
        adj[u].append([v, wt])
        adj[v].append([u, wt])

    return adj

# Returns shortest distances from src to all other vertices
def dijkstra(V, edges, src):
    # Create adjacency list
    adj = constructAdj(edges, V)

    # Create a priority queue to store vertices that
    # are being preprocessed.
    pq = []

    # Create a list for distances and initialize all
    # distances as infinite
    dist = [sys.maxsize] * V

    # Insert source itself in priority queue and initialize
    # its distance as 0.
    heapq.heappush(pq, [0, src])
    dist[src] = 0

    # Looping till priority queue becomes empty (or all
    # distances are not finalized)
    while pq:
        # The first vertex in pair is the minimum distance
        # vertex, extract it from priority queue.
        u = heapq.heappop(pq)[1]

        # Get all adjacent of u.
        for x in adj[u]:
            # Get vertex label and weight of current
            # adjacent of u.
            v, weight = x[0], x[1]

            # If there is shorter path to v through u.
            if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight:
                # Updating distance of v
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, [dist[v], v])

    # Return the shortest distance array
    return dist

# Driver program to test methods of graph class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    V = 5
    src = 0

    # edge list format: {u, v, weight}
    edges =[[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 8], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 10]];

    result = dijkstra(V, edges, src)

    # Print shortest distances in one line
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

```
