## Prompt:
how to solve dynamic programming problems ?

## Response:
Great question, Vishwanath 👏  
Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the **most important and tricky DSA topics**, but once you know the **right approach and patterns**, it becomes systematic — like solving puzzles with a recipe 🧠✨

Here’s a **step-by-step framework** to solve almost any **Dynamic Programming problem**, followed by **core patterns** and **examples** 👇

* * *

🧠 **1\. Understand What DP Is**
--------------------------------

Dynamic Programming is useful when:

*   The problem can be broken into **overlapping subproblems**.
*   There’s an **optimal substructure** (big problem’s solution depends on smaller subproblems’ solutions).

> 📝 **Key idea**: Solve smaller subproblems, **store the results**, and reuse them instead of recalculating.

* * *

🧭 **2\. Identify DP Problems Using These Clues**
-------------------------------------------------

Ask yourself:

*   Does the problem involve **decision making** (e.g., pick/not pick)?
*   Does it involve **optimization** (min/max ways, longest, shortest, largest)?
*   Are there **repeated calculations** (like recursive calls with same arguments)?
*   Can you break it down into **smaller problems** naturally?

👉 If yes to any of these — likely a DP problem.

* * *

📝 **3\. The 5-Step DP Problem-Solving Framework**
--------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Step 1: **Define the State**

Define what each DP state represents.  
For example:

*   `dp[i]` might mean _answer for first i elements_.
*   `dp[i][j]` might mean _answer considering first i elements and value j_.

> The **state** is usually related to **index, capacity, target, substring length, or choice**.

* * *

### ✅ Step 2: **State Transition**

Figure out **how to get from subproblems to the bigger problem**.

For example:

*   `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` (Fibonacci)
*   `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], value[i] + dp[i-1][j - weight[i]])` (Knapsack)

👉 This is usually derived from the recursive relationship.

* * *

### ✅ Step 3: **Base Cases**

Initialize the DP table correctly.

*   For example: `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to reach start)
*   Or `dp[0][0] = 0`, etc.

* * *

### ✅ Step 4: **Choose Top-Down (Memoization) or Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**

#### Top-Down (Memoization):

*   Use recursion + a dictionary/array to cache results.
*   Easy to write when the recurrence is natural.

```python
memo = {}
def dfs(i):
    if i in memo:
        return memo[i]
    # recursive logic
    memo[i] = result
    return result
```

#### Bottom-Up (Tabulation):

*   Fill a table iteratively from base cases up.
*   Usually more efficient in terms of stack usage.

```python
dp = [0]*(n+1)
dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
for i in range(2, n+1):
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
return dp[n]
```

* * *

### ✅ Step 5: **Extract the Answer**

The answer is usually in:

*   `dp[n]` for 1D DP
*   `dp[n][m]` for 2D DP
*   Or memo\[(n,...)\] if using top-down

* * *

🧰 **4\. Common Dynamic Programming Patterns**
----------------------------------------------

| Pattern | Example Problems | Key DP State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. 1D DP** | Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Min cost climbing stairs | `dp[i]` depends on `dp[i-1]`, `dp[i-2]` |
| **2\. 2D DP - Knapsack** | Subset sum, 0/1 Knapsack, Partition Equal Subset | `dp[i][j]`: first i items, capacity j |
| **3\. String DP** | Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance | `dp[i][j]`: prefix of string1, prefix of string2 |
| **4\. Subsequence/Substring** | Longest Increasing Subsequence, Palindromic Substrings | `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` with comparisons |
| **5\. Grid DP** | Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum | `dp[i][j]` depends on top and left neighbors |
| **6\. Interval DP** | Matrix Chain Multiplication, Burst Balloons | `dp[l][r]` depends on partitions between l & r |
| **7\. Bitmask DP** | Traveling Salesman, Subset Problems | `dp[mask][i]` states on visited subsets |

* * *

💡 **5\. Examples**
-------------------

### 🟢 **Example 1: Climbing Stairs (1D DP)**

LeetCode: 70\. Climbing Stairs

> “You can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways to climb n stairs?”

**Recurrence**:  
`ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`

**Tabulation**:

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2: return n
    dp = [0]*(n+1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

* * *

### 🟡 **Example 2: 0/1 Knapsack (2D DP)**

Classic optimization.

**State**: `dp[i][w]` = max value using first i items with capacity w  
**Transition**:

```
if weight[i] <= w:
  dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], value[i] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i]])
else:
  dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
```

* * *

### 🔵 **Example 3: Longest Common Subsequence (String DP)**

LeetCode: 1143\. LCS

**State**: `dp[i][j]` = LCS length of s1\[0..i-1\], s2\[0..j-1\]  
**Transition**:

```
if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
  dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
else:
  dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
```

* * *

⚡ **6\. Tips to Master DP**
---------------------------

*   🔸 **Start with recursion** → get the recurrence right → then memoize.
*   🔸 Don’t memorize 100 formulas. Instead, **identify the pattern**.
*   🔸 Draw recursion trees for small inputs to spot repeated subproblems.
*   🔸 Practice 1 pattern intensively (e.g., 1D DP) before moving on.
*   🔸 Space optimization: if `dp[i]` depends only on `i-1`, use 2 vars instead of array.

* * *

📌 Summary
----------

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Identify if it's a DP problem |
| 2️⃣ | Define state clearly |
| 3️⃣ | Derive recurrence (transition) |
| 4️⃣ | Implement either top-down or bottom-up |
| 5️⃣ | Extract answer and optimize if needed |
