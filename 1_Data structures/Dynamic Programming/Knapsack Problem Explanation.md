## Prompt:
what is knapsack problem

## Response:
The **Knapsack Problem** is a classic **optimization problem** in computer science and mathematics. It models a scenario where you must choose items to pack in a bag (knapsack) without exceeding its capacity, while **maximizing the total value** of the items selected.

* * *

### **Problem Statement (0/1 Knapsack)**

You're given:

*   `n` items, each with:
    
    *   a **weight** `w[i]`
        
    *   a **value** `v[i]`
        
*   A **maximum weight capacity** `W` of the knapsack
    

You must **select items** such that:

*   The **total weight** does not exceed `W`
    
*   The **total value** is maximized
    
*   Each item can be **either taken (1)** or **not taken (0)** ‚Äî hence **0/1 Knapsack**
    

* * *

### **Example**

Items:

| Item | Weight | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 4 | 5 | 7 |

Knapsack capacity = `7`

Best choice: Items 2 and 4 ‚Üí total weight = 3 + 4 = 7, total value = 4 + 5 = **9**

* * *

### **Variants**

*   **0/1 Knapsack**: Take each item at most once (most common).
    
*   **Fractional Knapsack**: Can take fractions of items ‚Äî solved with greedy algorithms.
    
*   **Unbounded Knapsack**: Can take an item multiple times.
    

* * *

### **Solution Approaches**

*   **Dynamic Programming** (most common for 0/1 Knapsack) ‚Äî O(nW) time
    
*   **Greedy Algorithm** ‚Äî only works optimally for fractional knapsack
    
*   **Backtracking / Branch and Bound** ‚Äî for complex variations or optimization

## Prompt:
how to solve knapsack problem

## Response:
To **solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem**, the most common and efficient method is using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Here's a step-by-step guide to solve it:

* * *

### üß† Problem Recap:

You're given:

*   `n` items, each with:
    
    *   `weight[i]` and `value[i]`
        
*   A knapsack with capacity `W`
    

Goal:

*   Maximize **total value**
    
*   Without exceeding **total weight ‚â§ W**
    
*   You **can‚Äôt split items** (0/1 only)
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Programming Approach (Bottom-Up)

We'll use a 2D DP table:

```
dp[i][w] = max value that can be obtained using first i items and capacity w
```

* * *

### üìå Steps:

1.  **Initialize a DP table** of size `(n+1) x (W+1)` with 0s.
    
2.  **Iterate** through items and capacities:
    
    *   If you **don‚Äôt include** the item: take value from above: `dp[i-1][w]`
        
    *   If you **include** the item:
        
        *   Check if weight allows: `w >= weight[i-1]`
            
        *   Add value: `value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]]`
            
    *   Take the **maximum** of the two choices.
        

* * *

### üßë‚Äçüíª Python Code

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, W):
    n = len(values)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(W + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(W + 1):
            if weights[i - 1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    dp[i - 1][w],
                    values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]

    return dp[n][W]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

* * *

### üïí Time & Space Complexity

*   **Time**: `O(n * W)`
    
*   **Space**: `O(n * W)` (can be optimized to `O(W)` with 1D array)
    

* * *

Do you want an explanation for the space-optimized version too?
