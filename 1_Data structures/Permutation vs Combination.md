## Prompt:
what is permutation and combination  with example

## Response:
### **Permutation and Combination**

Permutation and combination are concepts in **combinatorics**, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting and arrangements.

* * *

### **1\. Permutation**

Permutation refers to **the arrangement of objects in a specific order**. The order matters.

#### **Formula for Permutation:**

$$
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

where:

*    $n$  = total number of objects
    
*    $r$  = number of objects selected
    
*    $!$  (factorial) means multiplying all integers up to that number (e.g.,  $5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120$ )
    

#### **Example of Permutation:**

How many ways can you arrange 3 letters from the word **"ABC"**?

$$
P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = \frac{3!}{1!} = \frac{3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1}{1} = 6
$$

Possible arrangements: **AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB**  
(Since order matters, AB â‰  BA)

* * *

### **2\. Combination**

Combination refers to **selecting objects where the order does not matter**.

#### **Formula for Combination:**

$$
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

#### **Example of Combination:**

How many ways can you select 2 letters from "ABC" (without considering order)?

$$
C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = \frac{3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1}{2 Ã— 1 Ã— 1} = 3
$$

Possible selections: **AB, AC, BC**  
(Since order does not matter, AB = BA)

* * *

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature | Permutation | Combination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Order | Matters | Does not matter |
| Formula |  $P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$  |  $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$  |
| Example (choosing 2 from ABC) | AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB (6 ways) | AB, AC, BC (3 ways) |
