# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Explanation

## Prompt:

Bellman-Ford algorithm

## Response:

The **Bellman-Ford algorithm** is a classic algorithm used in **graph theory** to find the **shortest path** from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a **weighted graph**. It works even when some of the edge weights are **negative**, which is something **Dijkstra's algorithm** cannot handle.

---

### üîç Key Features

- Works on **directed or undirected** graphs.
- Can handle **negative weights**.
- Detects **negative weight cycles** (a cycle whose total weight is negative).
- Time Complexity: **O(V √ó E)** where V = number of vertices and E = number of edges.

---

### üß† Algorithm Steps

1.  Initialize distances:

    - Set distance to source as 0.
    - Set distance to all other vertices as ‚àû (infinity).

2.  Relax all edges **V - 1** times:

    - For each edge (u, v) with weight w:

      - If `distance[u] + w < distance[v]`, then update `distance[v] = distance[u] + w`.

3.  Detect negative weight cycle:

    - Repeat the same loop one more time. If any distance still gets updated, there‚Äôs a negative weight cycle.

### üßæ Pseudocode

```python
def bellman_ford(graph, V, E, src):
    # Step 1: Initialize distances
    dist = [float("inf")] * V
    dist[src] = 0

    # Step 2: Relax edges V - 1 times
    for _ in range(V - 1):
        for u, v, w in graph:
            if dist[u] != float("inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w

    # Step 3: Check for negative-weight cycles
    for u, v, w in graph:
        if dist[u] != float("inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            print("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
            return

    print("Vertex Distance from Source")
    for i in range(V):
        print(f"{i}\t\t{dist[i]}")
```

### üìå Example Input

```python
V = 5  # Number of vertices
E = 8  # Number of edges
graph = [
    (0, 1, -1),
    (0, 2, 4),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (1, 3, 2),
    (1, 4, 2),
    (3, 2, 5),
    (3, 1, 1),
    (4, 3, -3)
]

bellman_ford(graph, V, E, 0)
```

## Prompt:

## Response:

Awesome! Here's a **step-by-step visualization** of how the **Bellman-Ford algorithm** works on a sample graph. We‚Äôll use this example graph:

### üéØ Graph (Directed and Weighted)

```
     (0)
    /   \
  -1     4
  /       \
(1)---3--->(2)
 | \       ^

```

### üßæ Graph Representation

```
Vertices = 5
Edges:
(0 ‚Üí 1, weight = -1)
(0 ‚Üí 2, weight = 4)
(1 ‚Üí 2, weight = 3)
(1 ‚Üí 3, weight = 2)
(1 ‚Üí 4, weight = 2)
(3 ‚Üí 2, weight = 5)
(3 ‚Üí 1, weight = 1)
(4 ‚Üí 3, weight = -3)
```

### üß† Initialization

We start at **source vertex 0**.  
Initial distances:

| Vertex | Distance from 0 |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 0      | 0               |
| 1      | ‚àû               |
| 2      | ‚àû               |
| 3      | ‚àû               |
| 4      | ‚àû               |

---

### üîÅ Step 1: First iteration

Relax all edges:

- (0‚Üí1): 0 + (-1) = -1 ‚Üí dist\[1\] = -1
- (0‚Üí2): 0 + 4 = 4 ‚Üí dist\[2\] = 4
- (1‚Üí2): -1 + 3 = 2 ‚Üí dist\[2\] = 2 ‚úÖ
- (1‚Üí3): -1 + 2 = 1 ‚Üí dist\[3\] = 1
- (1‚Üí4): -1 + 2 = 1 ‚Üí dist\[4\] = 1
- (3‚Üí2): 1 + 5 = 6 ‚Üí ‚ùå no update
- (3‚Üí1): 1 + 1 = 2 ‚Üí ‚ùå no update
- (4‚Üí3): 1 + (-3) = -2 ‚Üí dist\[3\] = -2 ‚úÖ

New distances:

| Vertex | Distance |
| ------ | -------- |
| 0      | 0        |
| 1      | \-1      |
| 2      | 2        |
| 3      | \-2      |
| 4      | 1        |

---

### üîÅ Step 2: Second iteration

- (3‚Üí1): -2 + 1 = -1 ‚Üí ‚ùå (same)
- (4‚Üí3): 1 + (-3) = -2 ‚Üí ‚ùå (same)
- No further updates to any distances

‚úÖ Distances stabilized, but we continue to check in the next 2 rounds.

---

### üîÅ Step 3: Third iteration

No updates ‚Üí ‚úÖ

---

### üîÅ Step 4: Fourth iteration

No updates ‚Üí ‚úÖ

---

### üß™ Final check for negative weight cycle

No further updates ‚Üí ‚úÖ **No negative weight cycle**

---

### ‚úÖ Final Shortest Distances from Source (0)

| Vertex | Distance |
| ------ | -------- |
| 0      | 0        |
| 1      | \-1      |
| 2      | 2        |
| 3      | \-2      |
| 4      | 1        |
