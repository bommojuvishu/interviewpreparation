## Response:
Dijkstra's algorithm is a **graph search algorithm** used to find the **shortest path** from a **single source vertex** to all other vertices in a **weighted graph** with **non-negative edge weights**.

* * *

**How It Works**
----------------

1.  **Initialize Distances**: Set the distance of the source vertex to 0 and all others to infinity.
    
2.  **Use a Min-Priority Queue**: Maintain a min-heap (or priority queue) to always expand the nearest unvisited node.
    
3.  **Relax Edges**: For each adjacent vertex, update the shortest known distance if a shorter path is found.
    
4.  **Mark as Visited**: Once a vertex is processed (i.e., all its neighbors are relaxed), mark it as visited.
    
5.  **Repeat Until Done**: Continue until all vertices are processed.
    

* * *

**Time Complexity**
-------------------

*   **Using a simple array**:  $O(V^2)$ 
    
*   **Using a priority queue (Min-Heap)**:  $O((V + E) \log V)$ , where:
    
    *    $V$  is the number of vertices
        
    *    $E$  is the number of edges
        

* * *

**Implementation in Python**
----------------------------

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Priority queue (min-heap)
    pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
start_node = 'A'
print(dijkstra(graph, start_node))
```

* * *

**Use Cases**
-------------

*   **GPS Navigation** (Google Maps, Uber)
    
*   **Network Routing** (Shortest path in computer networks)
    
*   **AI Pathfinding** (Game development, robotics)
    
*   **Social Networks** (Finding shortest connections)

## Response:
Let's go through **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm step by step** with a small example.

* * *

**Example Graph**
-----------------

Consider this graph with **four nodes (A, B, C, D)** and the given weights:

```
       (1)
    A ------ B
     \      / \
   (4) \  (2) (5)
       C ------ D
         (1)
```

**Graph Representation (Adjacency List)**:

```
A â†’ B (1), C (4)
B â†’ A (1), C (2), D (5)
C â†’ A (4), B (2), D (1)
D â†’ B (5), C (1)
```

### **Goal**

Find the **shortest path** from **A** to all other nodes.

* * *

**Step-by-Step Execution**
--------------------------

1.  **Initialization**
    
    *   Start at **A**. Set:
        
        *   `distance(A) = 0` (starting point)
            
        *   `distance(B) = âˆž`
            
        *   `distance(C) = âˆž`
            
        *   `distance(D) = âˆž`
            
    *   Unvisited nodes: `{A, B, C, D}`
        
    *   Priority Queue: `[(0, A)]`
        

* * *

2.  **Processing Node A (Smallest Distance)**
    
    *   Current node = **A** (distance `0`)
        
    *   Visit its neighbors:
        
        *   **B**: `distance(A) + weight(A â†’ B) = 0 + 1 = 1`
            
        *   **C**: `distance(A) + weight(A â†’ C) = 0 + 4 = 4`
            
    *   Update distances:
        
        *   `distance(B) = 1`
            
        *   `distance(C) = 4`
            
    *   Add `(1, B)` and `(4, C)` to the priority queue.
        
    *   Unvisited nodes: `{B, C, D}`
        
    *   **Priority Queue**: `[(1, B), (4, C)]`
        

* * *

3.  **Processing Node B**
    
    *   Current node = **B** (distance `1`)
        
    *   Visit its neighbors:
        
        *   **A** (already visited, ignore)
            
        *   **C**: `distance(B) + weight(B â†’ C) = 1 + 2 = 3` (update, since `3 < 4`)
            
        *   **D**: `distance(B) + weight(B â†’ D) = 1 + 5 = 6`
            
    *   Update distances:
        
        *   `distance(C) = 3`
            
        *   `distance(D) = 6`
            
    *   Add `(3, C)` and `(6, D)` to the priority queue.
        
    *   Unvisited nodes: `{C, D}`
        
    *   **Priority Queue**: `[(3, C), (4, C), (6, D)]`
        

* * *

4.  **Processing Node C**
    
    *   Current node = **C** (distance `3`)
        
    *   Visit its neighbors:
        
        *   **A** (ignore)
            
        *   **B** (ignore)
            
        *   **D**: `distance(C) + weight(C â†’ D) = 3 + 1 = 4` (update, since `4 < 6`)
            
    *   Update distances:
        
        *   `distance(D) = 4`
            
    *   Add `(4, D)` to the priority queue.
        
    *   Unvisited nodes: `{D}`
        
    *   **Priority Queue**: `[(4, C), (4, D), (6, D)]`
        

* * *

5.  **Processing Node D**
    
    *   Current node = **D** (distance `4`)
        
    *   Visit its neighbors:
        
        *   **B** (ignore)
            
        *   **C** (ignore)
            
    *   No changes needed.
        
    *   **Priority Queue**: `[(6, D)]` (but D is already processed, so we stop)
        

* * *

**Final Shortest Distances**
----------------------------

| Node | Shortest Distance from A |
| --- | --- |
| **A** | 0 |
| **B** | 1 |
| **C** | 3 |
| **D** | 4 |

So, the **shortest paths** from **A**:

*   **A â†’ B** (1)
    
*   **A â†’ B â†’ C** (3)
    
*   **A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D** (4)
    

* * *

**Key Observations**
--------------------

*   The algorithm always **expands the nearest unvisited node**.
    
*   Once a node is processed, its distance is **final**.
    
*   Works well with **non-negative** weights.
    

* * *

**Time Complexity**
-------------------

*   **Using Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: ** $O((V + E) \log V)$ **
    
*   **Using Simple Array**: ** $O(V^2)$ ** (slower for large graphs)
    

* * *

**Python Implementation**
-------------------------

Here's how you can implement it:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

start_node = 'A'
print(dijkstra(graph, start_node))
```

* * *
