## Prompt:
instead of 2 pointer , if take list to manage window , how it effect the performance

## Response:
Great follow-up! Let‚Äôs dive deeper into **how using a list (like your `que`) compares to a two-pointer approach** from a **time and space complexity** perspective:

* * *

### üîé **1\. Your Approach with `que`:**

```python
que = []
```

*   **Adding an element (append)**: O(1) on average.
    
*   **Removing the first element (pop(0))**: O(n), because all elements after the first must be shifted left by one.
    

**In the worst case,** if your array is `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]` and `k` is large enough to flip many zeros, you‚Äôll have to pop(0) **many times**, each costing O(n).  
‚û°Ô∏è Overall time complexity: **O(n^2)** worst case.

* * *

### üîé **2\. Two-Pointer Approach:**

*   Uses `left` and `right` pointers (indices).
    
*   Increases `right` in a single loop, occasionally moves `left` forward.
    
*   Every element is **added to the window once** and **removed once**.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Overall time complexity: **O(n)** worst case.
    

* * *

### üîé **3\. Space Complexity Comparison:**

‚úÖ **Two-pointer:** O(1) space ‚Äî just 3-4 integer variables.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Queue:** O(n) space in worst case ‚Äî if all elements are 1s, the entire array is in the queue.

* * *

### üö® **Key Implications:**

| Factor | Queue/List | Two-pointer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Time per removal** | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Total time** | O(n^2) | O(n) |
| **Space usage** | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Suitability** | Small n | Large n |

* * *

### ‚ö° **Example:**

Suppose `nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]` and `k = 1`:

*   Using `que`, if the window grows to size 6 and you pop from the front repeatedly, that pop operation itself is O(n) each time ‚Äî it must shift all elements after it.
    
*   With pointers, you just increment `left`, no shifting required.
    

* * *

### üî• **Conclusion:**

*   **Two-pointer is almost always preferable** for sliding window problems ‚Äî it‚Äôs O(n) and uses constant space.
    
*   **Using a list-based window** adds overhead due to the cost of removing from the front (pop(0)) and extra space.
    

* * *

üí° **Recommendation:** If you want to stick to a list, consider using **collections.deque** which supports O(1) pops from both ends.  
But even then, a pointer approach is usually clearer and simpler!
