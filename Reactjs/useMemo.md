## Prompt:
how is usememo implemented

## Response:
The `useMemo` hook in React is a performance optimization tool that **memoizes the result of a computation** — meaning it caches the result and only recomputes it when its dependencies change.

Here's how it's conceptually implemented inside React (simplified version):

* * *

### ✅ Basic Conceptual Implementation of `useMemo`

```js
function useMemo(factory, deps) {
  const previous = ReactInternals.currentHookMemoState;

  if (!previous || !areDependenciesSame(previous.deps, deps)) {
    const value = factory();  // Run expensive calculation
    ReactInternals.currentHookMemoState = { value, deps };
    return value;
  }

  return previous.value; // Return cached value
}
```

* * *

### 🔍 Explanation:

1.  **`factory`**: A function you pass to `useMemo` that returns the computed value.
    
2.  **`deps`**: Dependency array — if these values change, React will re-run `factory`.
    
3.  **`areDependenciesSame`**: A shallow comparison function that checks if any value in the dependency array has changed.
    
4.  **Memoization**:
    
    *   On first render, React runs `factory()` and stores the result + deps.
        
    *   On re-renders, it checks `deps` — if **no change**, returns the **cached value**; if **changed**, re-runs `factory()`.
        

* * *

### ⚠️ Notable Points:

*   `useMemo` is scoped to the **render cycle**, not shared globally.
    
*   React internally manages an array of hooks per component instance to track their state across renders.
    
*   It does **not prevent re-renders**, it only **avoids expensive recalculations** during a render.
    

* * *

### ✅ Example Use Case:

```js
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeHeavyTask(data);
}, [data]);
```

This ensures `computeHeavyTask(data)` only runs when `data` changes.

* * *

Would you like a visualized or real-world use case too?

## Prompt:
lets say  that expensiveValue is returned in the JSX , 
if the value is cached then JSX return also do not execute ?

## Response:
Great question — and this touches on a **common misunderstanding**.

### 🔥 Short Answer:

**No**, even if `useMemo` returns a cached value, the **entire JSX in the component is still re-executed** during render.

* * *

### 🧠 Why?

React components are **functions**. When a component re-renders, it **re-executes the entire function**, including all `useMemo` calls and the JSX return.

However, `useMemo` **does not prevent re-rendering**. It just makes **certain calculations inside the render more efficient**.

* * *

### ✅ Example:

```jsx
function MyComponent({ count }) {
  console.log("Component Rendered");

  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Expensive calculation");
    return count * 1000;
  }, [count]);

  return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
}
```

### 👇 What Happens?

*   On **first render**:
    
    *   "Component Rendered"
        
    *   "Expensive calculation"
        
    *   JSX returns `<div>...</div>`
        
*   On **next render with same `count`**:
    
    *   "Component Rendered" ✅
        
    *   ❌ "Expensive calculation" (skipped)
        
    *   JSX is still re-executed with cached `expensiveValue`
        

* * *

### 🧩 Summary:

| Feature | Happens on every render? | Optimized by `useMemo`? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSX execution | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Component re-run | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Expensive calculation | ❌ No (if deps unchanged) | ✅ Yes |
| Re-rendering DOM | ❌ Not always (React diffs virtual DOM) | ✅ Indirectly |

* * *

Would you like to see this behavior live in a CodeSandbox or with a button to test rerenders?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Here’s a simple **React CodeSandbox example** that demonstrates how `useMemo` behaves, showing:

*   JSX re-renders every time.
    
*   `useMemo` avoids re-running expensive logic when dependencies don't change.
    

* * *

### ▶️ Open in CodeSandbox

* * *

### 📋 Code Snapshot:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(0);

  console.log("🔁 Component Rendered");

  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("💥 Expensive calculation running...");
    return count * 1000;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Expensive Value: {expensiveValue}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(otherState + 1)}>Trigger Re-render</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* * *

### 🧪 What to Test:

1.  Click **"Increment Count"**  
    🔸 Both "Component Rendered" and "Expensive calculation running..." are logged.
    
2.  Click **"Trigger Re-render"**  
    🔸 Only "Component Rendered" is logged — expensive logic is skipped.
    

* * *

Let me know if you want a version without `useMemo` to compare side-by-side.
