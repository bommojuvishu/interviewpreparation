## Response:
This code demonstrates how **debouncing** works in JavaScript — a common technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed, especially in response to rapid events like keystrokes or window resizing.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

* * *

### ✅ 1. **Debounce Function**

```js
function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeout;
    return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);  // Clear the previous timeout
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            func.apply(this, args);  // Call the original function with the latest arguments
        }, delay);
    };
}
```

*   **Purpose**: To delay the execution of `func` until there's a pause of `delay` milliseconds between calls.
    
*   **`timeout`**: Holds the ID of the pending `setTimeout`, so it can be cleared if another call comes in before the delay finishes.
    
*   **`clearTimeout(timeout)`**: Cancels any previously scheduled execution of the function.
    
*   **`setTimeout(..., delay)`**: Schedules a new function execution after the specified delay.
    
*   **`func.apply(this, args)`**: Ensures the original function is called with the correct `this` and arguments.
    

* * *

### ✅ 2. **Search Function**

```js
function search(query) {
    console.log('Searching for:', query);
}
```

*   A simple function that logs the search query.
    
*   In a real-world app, this might make an API call to fetch search results.
    

* * *

### ✅ 3. **Create Debounced Version**

```js
const dSearch = debounce(search, 100);
```

*   `dSearch` is a new function that wraps `search` in the debounce logic with a 100ms delay.
    

* * *

### ✅ 4. **Simulate Typing**

```js
dSearch('Hello');
dSearch('Hello, ');
dSearch('Hello, World!');
```

*   All three calls happen quickly in succession.
    
*   Because each call **cancels** the previous one’s timeout:
    
    *   Only the **last** call (`'Hello, World!'`) will actually result in `search()` being executed.
        
    *   This happens after **100ms of inactivity** following the last call.
        

* * *

### ⏱️ Real-Life Use Case

*   This pattern is often used in **search boxes** to reduce the number of API calls made while the user is typing.
    
*   It ensures that the function is triggered **only once**, after the user has **paused typing**.
