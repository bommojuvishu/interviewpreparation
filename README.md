# FAANG interview preparation

Good question, Vishwanath 👌  
Not all DSA topics carry equal weight in FAANG interviews — some appear **very frequently**, while others are **rare or optional**.  
Here’s a clear **“Most Important → Least Important” priority list** (based on FAANG patterns + LeetCode frequency):

---

## 🟩 **🔥 Tier 1 – Most Important (High ROI)**

👉 **Master these first. They cover 70–80% of interview questions.**

1.  **Arrays & Strings**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Patterns: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, in-place manipulation
    - Examples:
      - Longest substring without repeating chars
      - Trapping rain water
      - Merge intervals
2.  **Hashing (HashMaps / Sets)**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Used in: frequency counting, lookups, avoiding duplicates
    - Examples:
      - Two Sum
      - Group Anagrams
      - Longest consecutive sequence
3.  **Linked Lists**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐
    - Patterns: reversal, merge, cycle detection
    - Examples:
      - Reverse linked list
      - Detect cycle
      - Merge two sorted lists
4.  **Stacks & Queues**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐
    - Used for: parsing, monotonic stack patterns, next greater element
    - Examples:
      - Valid parentheses
      - Daily temperatures
      - Min stack
5.  **Recursion & Backtracking**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐
    - Patterns: subsets, permutations, DFS tree problems
    - Examples:
      - Subsets / combinations
      - N-Queens
      - Sudoku solver
6.  **Binary Trees & BSTs**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Patterns: DFS/BFS traversal, LCA, serialization
    - Examples:
      - Diameter of tree
      - Level order traversal
      - Validate BST

## 🟨 **✨ Tier 2 – Important but Secondary (Medium ROI)**

👉 Learn after Tier 1. Appears often in harder rounds.

7.  **Heaps / Priority Queues**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐
    - Patterns: Top K elements, scheduling, merging sorted lists
    - Examples:
      - Kth largest element
      - Merge k sorted lists
8.  **Graphs**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐
    - Patterns: BFS/DFS traversal, shortest paths, union-find
    - Examples:
      - Clone graph
      - Number of islands
      - Course schedule (topological sort)
9.  **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Frequency: ⭐⭐ but **high leverage for senior/onsite**
    - Patterns: subsequences, knapsack, matrix DP
    - Examples:
      - Coin change
      - Longest common subsequence
      - Unique paths in grid
10. **Sorting & Binary Search**

    - Frequency: ⭐⭐

- Binary search on sorted arrays, search space
- Examples:
  - Search rotated sorted array
  - Median of two sorted arrays

---

## 🟥 **🧊 Tier 3 – Least Important / Optional (Low ROI)**

👉 Good to know but don’t spend too much time unless you have extra weeks.

11. **Tries (Prefix Trees)**

    - Frequency: ⭐ (only appears in certain Google/Amazon rounds)

- Useful for autocomplete, prefix search 12. **Union-Find / Disjoint Sets**
  - Frequency: ⭐
- Appears mainly in graph connectivity / MST problems 13. **Segment Trees / Fenwick Trees**
  - Frequency: Rare
- Only for very algorithm-heavy interviews 14. **Math / Bit Manipulation**
  - Frequency: Rare
- Useful for niche problems (e.g., XOR tricks, subset generation)

| 🟩 1 | Arrays & Strings          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very High | Sliding window, intervals |
| 🟩 1 | Hashing                   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very High | Lookup, freq counting     |
| 🟩 1 | Trees (DFS/BFS)           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High      | Recursion, traversal      |
| 🟨 2 | Heaps / Graphs / DP       | ⭐⭐     | Medium    | Advanced rounds           |
| 🟨 2 | Sorting & Binary Search   | ⭐⭐     | Medium    | Searching patterns        |
| 🟥 3 | Tries / Union-Find / Bits | ⭐       | Low       | Rare / niche              |

### ✅ Recommendation for You

Since you’re an experienced engineer aiming FAANG:

- **Focus 80% on Tier 1 + Graphs + DP basics**
- **Spend 20%** on Tier 2 & Tier 3 if time allows
- Don’t chase rare data structures early. Master patterns & clarity of thought.
