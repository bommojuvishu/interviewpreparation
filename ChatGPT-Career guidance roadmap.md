**1\. Switch Domains: Move to a Developer-Friendly, Fast-Growing Domain**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Recommended domains (ranked for engineering satisfaction + growth):

### **Top Recommendations**

1.  **SaaS / Product (B2B or B2C)**
    *   Best engineering culture
    *   Clean architecture
    *   Modern stacks (React/Next.js + Node/Python + Postgres)
    *   Opportunity to build multiple projects
    *   Direct business impact → faster career growth
2.  **E-commerce / Travel Tech (Agoda, Booking, Amazon, Flipkart)**
    *   Tons of scale, very strong engineering challenges
    *   Singapore hiring is massive
    *   They need strong JS engineers + microservices skills
3.  **HealthTech / Pharma Tech (Sanofi, Practo, Healthify, Dr. Reddy’s Digital)**
    *   Data-heavy but _not finance-heavy_
    *   Better documentation and structured workflows
    *   Many internal SaaS tools → your experience fits perfectly
4.  **AI-Enabled Apps / Platforms (SaaS + AI)**
    *   Your horoscope AI app shows potential
    *   Combine React + Flask + AI inference → strong niche

* * *

**2\. Build 1 Strong “Flagship Project” for Interviews**
--------------------------------------------------------

You already have:

*   Invesco Vision (complex, impressive)
*   Rules Engine creation
*   Python Flask CRUD APIs
*   React + Next.js knowledge

### Build this now:

### **A multi-tenant SaaS app with:**

*   Neon DB / Postgres
*   Next.js 15 + App Router
*   Authentication (Login via Firebase or Clerk)
*   Billing (Stripe)
*   CRUD + workflows
*   Admin panel
*   Deploy on Vercel + Fly.io + AWS

This single project **dramatically boosts your Singapore/job-hunting profile**.

* * *

**3\. Start Your Singapore Job Preparation**
--------------------------------------------

Singapore companies value:

*   DSA (medium level)
*   System design
*   Scalable API design
*   Cloud architecture
*   Strong frontend (React/Next.js)

### Your strengths match 70% already

You need to improve the remaining 30%:

### **Action plan**

*   **DSA: 60 problems (Leetcode patterns)** → enough for 90% of interviews
*   **System design: 10 high-level designs**
*   **Revamp resume to Singapore standards**
*   **Start applying on:**
    *   LinkedIn
    *   Hired
    *   Careers at Agoda, Grab, Shopee, GovTech

You are _definitely competitive_ for 60–70 LPA equivalent packages.

* * *

**4\. Short-term Goal (3–6 Months): Switch to a Lighter Domain Inside India**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before Singapore, consider a role change now:

*   Sanofi (you already asked about it)
*   Health-tech startups
*   SaaS companies
*   Edtech product teams
*   HRMS/CRM product companies

These give:

*   Better work-life balance
*   Cleaner tech stack
*   More product build experience
*   More interview-ready profile

* * *

**5\. Start Your Own Small SaaS on the Side (Highly Recommended)**
------------------------------------------------------------------

You already have:

*   Experience building a rules engine
*   Vision for school management software
*   Ability to build A–Z product

### Pick one niche SaaS:

*   School management (your idea)
*   Apartment association billing
*   Simple accounting for small shops
*   AI + astrology (your existing app can become a subscription SaaS)

Even ₹30,000/month from a side SaaS is huge leverage.

* * *

📌 **Where You Fit Best**
=========================

### 🎯 **Senior Full-Stack Engineer → Lead Engineer → Solution Architect**

You have:

*   10+ years
*   AWS certification
*   Full-stack skills
*   Enterprise experience

You should move towards:

*   **Tech lead roles**
*   **Architect roles**
*   **SaaS product ownership roles**

* * *

🧠 **What You Must Learn in the Next 6 Months**
===============================================

1.  **Deep DSA (at least 60 practice problems)**
2.  **System design (APIs, scaling, caching, queues)**
3.  **Next.js 15 full mastery**
4.  **Neon/Postgres advanced queries**
5.  **AI integration basics (OpenAI APIs)**

* * *

💰 Expected Salary Growth Path
==============================

### **Current:** 36 LPA

### **Next job in India:** 45–55 LPA

### **Singapore:** 140k–170k SGD/year (approx ₹80–100 LPA take-home)

### **Own SaaS:** unlimited potential + stable passive income

* * *

==================================

✅ A personalized DSA roadmap  
✅ A new resume optimized for Singapore  
✅ A career timeline (month-by-month plan)  
✅ A portfolio project plan  
✅ A mock interview set for Agoda

Would you like me to prepare those for you?
